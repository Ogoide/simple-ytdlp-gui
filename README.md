# A simple yt-dlp GUI

This is, like you proably have already guessed, yet another user interface for the popular video and audio downloader yt-dlp, a fork of YoutubeDL.
This project was built primarily with the objective of testing my knowledge on working with GUIs (namely, tkinter) and with external packages, thus serving as a learning exercise.
 
Despite that, since I've already made this barebones tool, anyone who might find it usable is free to do with as they please, especially testing it and, if you so desire, requesting new features. 

## Installation
You have to have installed the yt-dlp package and you also need ffmpeg and ffmprobe as well, obivously, Python(3.12). You can download one of the custom builds available at https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds and simply move the executables to the same folder as the scripts. The gui.py script is what you should run, as the functions.py only provides the functions that I didn't want to clog the main script too much. In the future I *might* add an exe file to the project, hopefully once I learn how to do so, but for now, this is how it works.
